# Video player scope

This document describes a video-player proof of concept. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate skills of implementing a video player for HLS and MPEG-DASH video assets. 

Here's the scope of the player:
 - As a user, I want to see a list of available clips
 - As a user, I want to play selected clip
 - As a user, I want to fast-forward the video
 - As a user, I want to stop playback
 - As a user, I want to change audio volume, mute/unmute volume
 - As a user, I want to change resolution of the video playback
 - As a user, I want to switch between HLS and MPEG-DASH video assets.

Implementation requirements:
 - Implementation for MPEG-DASH should not use already written player libraries. 
 - Implementation for HLS can use player library of your choosing. 
 - Video player should have custom video controls.
